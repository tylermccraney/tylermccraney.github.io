title: About Me

I use population genomic and phylogenetic comparative methods on â€˜big data', generated via whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatic/ecological database mining, to understand the ecology, evolution, and conservation of fishes and plant pathogens. I'm especially interested in understanding how rates of molecular, phenotypic, and species evolution vary over eco-geological timescales with respect to mutualisms, climate change, and habitat fragmentation.
