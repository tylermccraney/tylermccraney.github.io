title: About Me

I use genomics, data science, and phylogenetic comparative methods on â€˜big data' from whole-genome sequencing and biological database mining to understand the ecology, evolution, and conservation of fishes and plant pathogens. I'm especially interested in discovering how rates of molecular, phenotypic, and species evolution vary over ecological/geological timescales with respect to mutualisms, climate change, and habitat fragmentation.
