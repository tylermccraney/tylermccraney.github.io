title: About Me

I use 'big data' generated from whole-genome sequencing and ecological database mining to understand the ecology, evolution, and conservation of fishes and plant pathogens. I'm especially interested in discovering how rates of molecular, phenotypic, and lineage diversification vary over ecological and geological timescales with respect to mutualisms, climate change, and habitat fragmentation.
