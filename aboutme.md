title: About Me
---

I'm a Lecturer in the Department of Biological Sciences and a Research Associate in the Departments of Fisheries Biology and Forestry Wildland Resources at Cal Poly Humboldt. My research involves the use of population genomic and phylogenetic comparative methods on ‘big data' – generated via whole-genome sequencing or mining public bioinformatic and biodiversity databases – to explain the ecology and evolution of marine animals and fungal-like plant pathogens. I'm especially interested in understanding how rates of molecular, phenotypic, and species evolution vary over eco-geological timescales with respect to mutualisms, climate change, and conservation.
